# Interactive Form
## Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree Unit 3

This project was graded **Exceeds Expectations**.

Extra Credit features included:
- the color label and select menu are hidden unless a t-shirt style is selected
- the credit card field has two error messages, one for a blank field and one for a bad field
- all fields validated on 'keyup' or 'change' to provide real-time error messages

This project presents an interactive form with client-side form validation,
created using unobtrusive JavaScript so that the page will still load in
limited browsers or if JavaScript is disabled for any reason. The form will
not submit if there are any validation errors.
