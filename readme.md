# Interactive-Form
 Unit 3, Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript TechDegree Program

Attention Treehouse: Extra Credit features included:
    - color label and select menu are hidden unless a t-shirt style is selected
    - the credit card field has two error messages, one for a blank field and one for a bad field
    - all fields validated on 'keyup' or 'change' to provide real-time error messages
    - added css to control the positioning of several of the error messages (.xxx-message rules)

This project presents an interactive form with client-side form validation,
created using unobtrusive JavaScript so that the page will still load in
limited browsers or if JavaScript is disabled for any reason. The form will
not submit if there are any validation errors.
